Beginner's Guide to ZFS:

- Don’t use blockstorage for files! Instead use datasets for files.
- Separate your files from VM data.
- Your VM data is stored in zvols and blockstorage. For blockstorage, use NVMe mirrors (or at least SSDs).
- Don't use RAIDZ1
- Never use RAIDZ2 for blockstorage.
- Use RAIDZ2 only for large files that are sequentially read and written.
- Max out your RAM. You can use RAM for ARC. Set the zfs_arc_max value! For a NAS, 90% is a good value. For a hypervisor, use 50% or as much RAM as you can spare.
- If you need a special vdev, add it before moving data to your pool.
- Don’t use L2ARC or SLOG from the start. There's a high chance your workload won’t need them. If needed, you can still add them later.

**If you don’t understand a term here (like ARC or blockstorage) read up on it first!**
