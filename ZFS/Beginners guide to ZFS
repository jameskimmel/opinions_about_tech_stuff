Beginners guide to ZFS:

- Don’t use blockstorage for files, instead use datasets for files
- Separate your files from VM data
- You VM data is zvols and blockstorage. For blockstorage use NVMe mirrors (or at least SSD)
- Never use RAIDZ for blockstorage!
- Use RAIDZ2 only for big files that are sequentially read and written
- Max out RAM. You can use RAM for ARC. Set the zfs_arc_max value! For a NAS, 90% is a good value, for a hypervisor it is 50% or as much RAM as you can spare. 
- If you need special vdev, you have to add it before you move data to your pool
- Don’t use L2ARC or SLOG from the start. There is a high chance that your workload won’t need it. If needed you can still add it later on.
