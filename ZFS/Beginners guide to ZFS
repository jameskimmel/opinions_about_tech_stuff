Beginners guide to ZFS:

- Don’t use blockstorage for files, instead use datasets
- Separate files from VM data
- Don’t use RAIDZ for blockstorage
- Use RAIDZ2 for big files that are sequentially read and written
- Max out RAM. RAM will be used for ARC. 
- If you need special vdev, you have to add it before you move data to your pool
- Don’t use L2ARC or SLOG from the start. There is a high chance that your workload won’t need it. If needed you can still add it later on.
