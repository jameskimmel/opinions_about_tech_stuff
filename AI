My opinion on current “AI” is simple. It is not AI but LLM.  

So I treat it as a LLM.
Is it intelligent? No
What is it then? It is a blabbermouth model.

So I ask myself the question, for what can I use a blabbermouth model?

Good use case:
- Asking it to write a bedtime story containing a crocodile and a penguin
- Asking it to check a text you have ALREADY WRITTEN (not to write a text for you!)

Semi good use case: 
Asking it to write some lines of code for my project

Bad use case:
- Asking it very basic facts. Like, can my dog eat chocolate? How many displays can I connect to an M1 Macbook Air? How many "r" are in this text? 
- Asking it very basic question that require context
- Asking it very basic question for stuff that does not have a "one size fits all" solution


My biggest gripe is that people use it often for the in my opinion bad use cases, which could mislead them and also is potentially dangerous. 
will mislead them and I don’t want to read your soulless AI babble.Biggest field I see in the future is AI girlfirend and boyfriend. 
Currently only in text, maybe later even with video. So many people are alone and/or horny.

The internet was made for porn.
AI will be made for fake relationships and porn.
