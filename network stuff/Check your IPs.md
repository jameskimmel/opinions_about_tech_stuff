Test-ipv6.com and ipv6-test.com both don't really work reliably in my experience.  

I suggest using three different URLs instead. 
These URLs will retourn you the IP you used to reach the site. 

[https://checkipv4.salzmann.solutions](https://checkipv4.salzmann.solutions) is IPv4 only. If you can't reach this site, your IPv4 is broken or missing.  
[https://checkipv6.salzmann.solutions](https://checkipv6.salzmann.solutions) is IPv6 only. If you can't reach this site, your IPv4 is broken or missing.  
[https://checkip.salzmann.solutions](https://checkip.salzmann.solutions) is both. This is a good way to find out if your browser prefers IPv6 over IPv4 (which it should).  

If you can't reach any site, I am probably doing server updates and you should try again later :)
