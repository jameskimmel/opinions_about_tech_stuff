Test-ipv6.com and ipv6-test.com both don't really work reliably.  

I suggest using my domains instead. 
These domains will give you the IP you have used to reach the site. 

[https://checkipv4.salzmann.solutions](https://checkipv4.salzmann.solutions) is IPv4 only. If you can't reach this site, your IPv4 is broken or missing (or my servers are down)  
[https://checkipv6.salzmann.solutions](https://checkipv6.salzmann.solutions) is IPv6 only. If you can't reach this site, your IPv4 is broken or missing (or my servers are down)  
[https://checkip.salzmann.solutions](https://checkip.salzmann.solutions) is both. This is a good way to find out if your browser prefers IPv6 over IPv4 (which it should).
